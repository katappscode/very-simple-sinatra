# Very Simple Sinatra

This is an extremely simple Ruby application. It runs a simple Sinatra web server and says 'Hello World'. 

By default it listens on port `4567` but can be configured with the `PORT` environment variable. The `BIND_ADDRESS` variable can be used to change the bind address from `0.0.0.0` to anything preferred.

## Running

```bash
$ bundle
$ ruby server.rb
```
